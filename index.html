                Hi, my name is Nick Sundermeyer. I'm a Junior studying Computer Science and Game Development at the University of Denver, with minors in Mathematics and Emergent Digital Practices. I have experience with programming, graphic design, and 3D modeling, and I'm especially passionate about games and everything related to them!

                My primary interest in art lies in imagining and creating new worlds to explore. This worldbuilding includes creating environments and spaces, but also situations, characters, and the stories surrounding these new places. These different parts weave together to create textured creations which are both visually interesting and reflect upon our own world. The worlds I create, whether they be castles built from Lego or levels of a videogame, act as a counterpoint to the real world, a place where the normal rules donâ€™t apply and so can be examined from an outside perspective. I start from a simple idea for the place I want to create, adding layers and pieces to the world to expand on this idea and tying all the pieces together into a cohesive whole that flows through the space with a purpose. I try to make worlds that engage, which have a concrete idea of what they are but also encourage the viewer to imagine beyond the borders of the environment itself.
