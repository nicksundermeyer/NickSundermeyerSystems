                <p class="card-text"> The original DOOM game, developed by id Software in 1993, is widely considered one of the most influential games of all time. The game pushed the envelope in terms of what was possible with immersive 3D graphics at the time, allowing players to explore the sci-fi corridors of Phobos, Deimos, and finally Hell itself while fighting enemies and collecting a variety of weapons. The gameplay was fast and frantic, with enemies coming from all around the player.

                    <p class="card-text">The game was also a pioneer in the areas of online networked play, with a competitive online mode that allowed players to battle against each other, as well as customized modifications to the game created by players. The game is credited with catapulting the FPS genre into the massive role it has in the games industry today.</p>

                    The second game in the DOOM franchise came out only a year after the original, and the game was more of an iteration and refinement of the mechanics, gameplay, and technical achievements of the first. The team expanded on their original vision for DOOM, taking advantage of advances in computer technology to create more expansive levels and refine the gameplay of the original into a formula that defined the popular FPS games of the era.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most interesting part of the refinement is the change in level design philosophy. The fairly linear levels of the original turned into expansive labyrinths with the second iteration, with multiple paths through the level and a variety of secrets and powerups that could be discovered by the player through exploration. The influences from this level design can be seen in 2016's reboot as well as many of the popular games that came between.

                    DOOM uses its enemy design to push the player towards a certain playstyle, as well as to put them into uncomfortable situations to get them to change up how they approach different situations. The designers of the games wanted players to feel powerful, and to constantly be "pushing forward" against enemies, not running from them. To this end, the game uses a variety of enemy types that all act differently to create a variety of situations for the player. Here are a few of DOOM's enemies:

                <p class="card-text">
                    Imp: The most common enemy found in the games, these enemies attack with a ranged fireball. They are generally fairly easy to defeat, but their ranged pokes can annoy and distract while focused on other enemies.
                </p>
                <img src="res/enemies/demon-2.jpg" class="enemies-image center">
                <p class="card-text">
                    Demon: A relatively large monster which, when it sees the player, roars and charges the player in a rush. while not particularly dangerous alone, they can swarm the player and overwhelm them. They also have a tendency to try to flank the player, forcing them to keep moving and stay aware of their surroundings.
                </p>

                <img src="res/enemies/cacodemon.jpg" class="enemies-image center">
                <p class="card-text">
                    Cacodemon: These floating heads tend to keep their distance, attacking and moving slowly. However, they float high above the battlefield, and can be a nuisance to track down and kill, especially given their high health. They are also constantly flanking the player, as they can fly over obstacles and come from unexpected angles.

                    The series' first reboot came in the form of DOOM 3 in 2005, which ignored the events of the first games and reset the series to a futuristic Martian setting. The game focused far more on story than the previous entries to the series, with fully voice-acted characters and cutscenes to follow. The story revolved around a lab on Mars in which some of the scientists worked in collaboration with the forces of Hell to open the gates and let forth the demons.

                <p class="card-text">
                    The game was critically and comercially successful, with praise for its next-generation graphics and presentation. It also brought DOOM's darker atmosphere into the modern-day, and tested the waters for real storytelling in a DOOM game. Despite these advances, it also went back to a more linear style to incorporate the story, which many saw as a step backwards from the open-ended levels that players were used to from the franchise.
