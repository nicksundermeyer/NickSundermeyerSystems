                <p class="card-text"> The original DOOM game, developed by id Software in 1993, is widely considered one of the most influential games of all time. The game pushed the envelope in terms of what was possible with immersive 3D graphics at the time, allowing players to explore the sci-fi corridors of Phobos, Deimos, and finally Hell itself while fighting enemies and collecting a variety of weapons. The gameplay was fast and frantic, with enemies coming from all around the player.

                    <p class="card-text">The game was also a pioneer in the areas of online networked play, with a competitive online mode that allowed players to battle against each other, as well as customized modifications to the game created by players. The game is credited with catapulting the FPS genre into the massive role it has in the games industry today.</p>

                    id Software went on to continue the series with DOOM 2 and DOOM 3, as well as multiple spin-offs and other titles. id them went on hiatus from the series from 2004 until 2016, when they released the first new DOOM game since DOOM 3.

                    The Doom games have always been games that pushed the boundaries for what was possible in immersive 3D graphics at the time of their development. Doom 1 was based on the "id Tech 1" engine, which represented a technological leap over their previous FPS, Wolfenstein 3D. Levels were generated from a top-down 2D map, which meant that rooms could not be on top of one another. However, the game was able to use this and other techniques to allow the game to run quickly even on the hardware of the time, enabling features like multiplayer which were not previously possible.

                <p class="card-text">
                    As the games advanced through the series, the graphics advanced along with the industry. DOOM 3 sports graphics ore in line with what modern games look like, with realistic textures and 3D models, improved lighting techniques, and more advanced postprocessing. It also popularized a new technique for rendering realistic shadows in real-time, and experimented with new ways to stream textures to allow for higher resolutions on large environments.

                <p class="card-text">
                    Finally we come to DOOM 2016, the most recent game in the series. The game took cues from what was built before it, while adding many layers of advanced techniques. It also added support for a new graphics API called Vulkan, a cross-platform and performant alternative to the popular standard OpenGL. Looking at the history of the DOOM franchise is a fascinating look at how graphics in games have changed so much in a such a short time. The difference between 1993 and 2016 is impressive, as can be seen below in a video by IGN comparing the two games.

                    The second game in the DOOM franchise came out only a year after the original, and the game was more of an iteration and refinement of the mechanics, gameplay, and technical achievements of the first. The team expanded on their original vision for DOOM, taking advantage of advances in computer technology to create more expansive levels and refine the gameplay of the original into a formula that defined the popular FPS games of the era.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most interesting part of the refinement is the change in level design philosophy. The fairly linear levels of the original turned into expansive labyrinths with the second iteration, with multiple paths through the level and a variety of secrets and powerups that could be discovered by the player through exploration. The influences from this level design can be seen in 2016's reboot as well as many of the popular games that came between.

                    DOOM uses its enemy design to push the player towards a certain playstyle, as well as to put them into uncomfortable situations to get them to change up how they approach different situations. The designers of the games wanted players to feel powerful, and to constantly be "pushing forward" against enemies, not running from them. To this end, the game uses a variety of enemy types that all act differently to create a variety of situations for the player. Here are a few of DOOM's enemies:

                <img src="res/enemies/imp-2.jpg" class="enemies-image center">
                <p class="card-text">
                    Imp: The most common enemy found in the games, these enemies attack with a ranged fireball. They are generally fairly easy to defeat, but their ranged pokes can annoy and distract while focused on other enemies.
                </p>
                <img src="res/enemies/demon-2.jpg" class="enemies-image center">
                <p class="card-text">
                    Demon: A relatively large monster which, when it sees the player, roars and charges the player in a rush. while not particularly dangerous alone, they can swarm the player and overwhelm them. They also have a tendency to try to flank the player, forcing them to keep moving and stay aware of their surroundings.
                </p>

                <img src="res/enemies/cacodemon.jpg" class="enemies-image center">
                <p class="card-text">
                    Cacodemon: These floating heads tend to keep their distance, attacking and moving slowly. However, they float high above the battlefield, and can be a nuisance to track down and kill, especially given their high health. They are also constantly flanking the player, as they can fly over obstacles and come from unexpected angles.

                    The level design philosophy of the games, since DOOM 2 popularized the explorative nature of its levels, has in general been very open-ended for the player. They enter the level, and there will be an exit somewhere, but between these points are many possible pathways to take. Exploration rewards the player with secrets, powerups, and new weapons. This adds another layer onto the fast-paced shooter gameplay of the first game, giving the player something to do while in between fights. It also gives some player choice to how they progress through the game, allowing a player to decide to collect as many of the secrets as possible, or to simply head straight to the exit and move on to the next level.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    This style of level design was extremely popular in the early days of FPS games, in large part due to DOOM 2's popularity. However, nonlinear level design fell out of popular use for a while in the early 2000s with the modern military shooter genre favoring linear, scripted storylines. However, recent years have brought back the love for large and complex levels, and especially the old style of secret-hunting. This style was used in the newest DOOM game as well as other remakes of older FPS games (such as Wolfenstein).

                    The series' first reboot came in the form of DOOM 3 in 2005, which ignored the events of the first games and reset the series to a futuristic Martian setting. The game focused far more on story than the previous entries to the series, with fully voice-acted characters and cutscenes to follow. The story revolved around a lab on Mars in which some of the scientists worked in collaboration with the forces of Hell to open the gates and let forth the demons.

                    The game was critically and comercially successful, with praise for its next-generation graphics and presentation. It also brought DOOM's darker atmosphere into the modern-day, and tested the waters for real storytelling in a DOOM game. Despite these advances, it also went back to a more linear style to incorporate the story, which many saw as a step backwards from the open-ended levels that players were used to from the franchise.

                    The DOOM franchise has has an interesting relationship with story. The originals were minimal affairs, with no real story to speak of besides a basic setting. Even the main character is simply called "Doomguy". However, they tried a more involved story with DOOM 3, making the game more linear and incorporating voice acting and actual character development. This was met with mixed reception, because while people do like a good story, they also didn't like when control was taken away from the player to tell that story.

                <p class="card-text">
                    This divide between story and gameplay has been an age-old problem in video games. It's hard to tell an interesting story to a player who is actively able to move around, and a lot of thought must go into directing the player's attention to important story elements. The Half-Life games, released in 1998 and 2004, represented the next evolution in linear game storylines that were immersive, but never took control away from the player. Half-Life and the games influenced by it changed the expectations for storytelling in an FPS, and the lessons learned were passed forward and utilized in DOOM 2016.

                    The DOOM 2016 project is unique in the world of video games. A reboot to one of the longest-running game franchises of all time, attempting to both call back to those classic games while taking the lessons expected in modern games. It takes elements from the original games, the reboot of the third game, as well as from the huge variety of FPS games that have developed since DOOM popularized the genre 25 years ago.
                </p>
                <h5>Design Philosophy</h5>
                <p class="card-text">
                    The primary design philosophy of this game is to once again find the "push forward" style of combat from the original game. Although in the intervening games the franchise has tried slowing things down and making them more linear, DOOM 2016 returns to the series' roots. It uses techniques like enemies dropping health on death, as well as the enemy
                    <a href="#enemies">archetypes</a> set forth in the original games, to keep the player moving and actively engaging enemies. It returns to the large and complex
                    <a href="#level">levels</a> of DOOM 2, with many secrets to find. It also combines this explorative gameplay with first person platforming, something that has been developed in FPS games since the time of the originals.

                <img src="res/doom/fistbump.gif" class="pageImage center">
                <h5>Storytelling</h5>
                <p class="card-text">
                    DOOM 2016 strikes a good balance between having a story, but one that isn't in your face, much of which can be ignored at the player's discretion. It uses a "live" form of storytelling which never takes control away from the player, but uses voiceovers and optional collectables to give the player as much or as little story as they wish to search for. It also takes cues from the Half-Life games, which were incredibly influential in the area of integrating a game's
                    <a href="#story">storyline</a> into the gameplay.
                </p>
                <h5>Modern Elements</h5>
                <p class="card-text">
                    A lot has developed in the intervening time from 1993 to 2016 in the world of games, and while DOOM 2016 calls back to the originals in many ways, it also modernizes these elements. Just as it takes a modern approach to telling old-school stories, it also combines fast gameplay with modern platforming mechanics and vertical level design. The sound design is also incredibly important and combines classic and modern music and new sound mixing techniques to create a varied soundscape. Finally, it incorporates RPG elements and upgrade systems popularized by games like Skyrim to round out the package and add a sense of progression.
